slowmoving aimless movie distressed drifting young man
sure lost flat characters audience nearly half walked
attempting artiness black white clever camera angles movie disappointed became even ridiculous acting poor plot lines almost nonexistent
little music anything speak
best scene movie gerardo trying find song keeps running head
rest movie lacks art charm meaning emptiness works guess empty
wasted two hours
wasted two hours
saw movie today thought good effort good messages kids
bit predictable
loved casting jimmy buffet science teacher
baby owls adorable
movie showed lot florida best made look appealing
songs best muppets hilarious
cool
right case movie delivers everything almost right face
average acting main person low budget clearly can see
review long overdue since consider tale two sisters single greatest film ever made
ill put gem movie terms screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing aspect filmmaking
practically perfect true masterpiece sea faux masterpieces
structure film easily tightly constructed history cinema
can think film something vitally important occurs every minute
words content level film enough easily fill dozen films
can anyone right mind ask anything movie
quite simply highest superlative form cinema imaginable
yes film require rather significant amount puzzlesolving pieces fit together create beautiful picture
short film certainly pulls punches
graphics far best part game
number one best th game series
deserves strong love
insane game
massive levels massive unlockable characters just massive game
waste money game
kind money wasted properly
actually graphics good time
today graphics crap
say canada fun game aye
game rocks
buy play enjoy love
pure brilliance
flick doomed conception
idea lame take minor character mediocre film make complete nonsequel changing tone pgrated family movie
wasnt least bit interested
confirm film unfunny generic also managed give away entire movie im exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke told trailer
just funny
even talented carrell cant save
costars dont fare much better people like morgan freeman jonah hill ed helms just wasted
story just predictable lazy
real effects work presence animals integration scenes worst obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen
whatever cost much didnt translate quality thats sure
film succeeds despite perhaps obviously meagre budget
im glad film didnt go obvious choice lesser film certainly
addition one lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one cutest leading ladies ever grace screen
hard fall headoverheels love girl
negative insipid enough cause regret another 2 hours life wasted front screen
long whiny pointless
recommend waiting future efforts let one go
excellent cast story line performances
totally believable
anne heche utterly convincing
sam shepards portrayal gung ho marine sobering
sat riveted tv screen
give one resounding 9
think tom hanks good actor
enjoyed reading book children little
disappointed movie
one character totally annoying voice gives feeling fingernails chalkboard
totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene
absolutely warmth charm scenes characters
movie totally grates nerves
performances improved improvisation actors now twice much worry whether theyre delivering line well whether line good
quite honestly often good
often dialogue doesnt really follow one line another fit surroundings
crackles unpredictable youthful energy honestly found hard follow concentrate meanders badly
generally great things
wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours time though
suspense builders good just cross line g pg
especially liked noncliche choices parents movies predict dialog verbatim writing movie made better selections
want movie thats gross gives chills great choice
alexander nevsky great film
amazing film artist one important whoever lived
im glad pretentious piece s didnt planned dodge stratus big shots gonna help movie makers arent restrained movie business qubec
first movie ive given years
ever movie needed wordofmouth promote
overall film interesting thoughtprovoking
plus wellpaced suited relatively short run time
give one look
gave
wind lion well written superbly acted
true classic
actually turned pretty decent far blist horrorsuspense films go
definitely worth checking
problem script
horrendous
nothing believable
suspense feeling frustration just retarded girls
manna heaven terrific film predictable unpredictable time
scenes often funny occasionally touching characters evaluate lives going
cast veteran actors just nostalgia trip
ursula burtons portrayal nun touching funny time making fun nuns church
looking movie terrific cast good musicincluding shirley jones rendition way look tonight uplifting ending give one try
dont think will disappointed
frankly cotton club unfaithful kind embarrassing watch lane gere film bad
acting bad dialogs extremely shallow insincere
predictable even chick flick
politically correct
disappointing
thing really worth watching scenery house beautiful
love lane ive never seen movie lousy
hour half wish bring back
terms writing fresh bold
acting helps writing along well maybe idiotsavant sister played better real joy watch
directing cinematography arent quite good
movie boring sometimes found occupied peaking paper instead watching never happened columbo movie
sometimes embarrassing look away
directing seems pretentious
scenes ohsomature neighbourgirl misplace
generally lines plot weaker average episode
scene debated whether sack trumpeter falsely accused murder pure horror really stupid
applause given prelude however
really liked
great film great director
movie edge seat made somewhat afraid go car end night
music film really nice
id advise anyone go see
brilliant

liked movie way much
problem thought actor playing villain low rent michael ironside
rocked world certainly must see anyone social physical outlets
however didnt make fact overall tremendously boring movie
chemistry ben affleck sandra bullock film couldnt understand consider even leaving wifetobe chick supposedly knocked
several moments movie just didnt need excruciatingly slow moving
poor remake best friends wedding
great disappointment
believe actors agreed film
stand even watch long fear losing iq
guess nobody network aired dribble watched putting
imdb ratings go low awful time get negative numbers cases
saw mirrormask last night unsatisfactory experience
unfortunately inexperience direction meant scene scene passed little way dramatic tension conflict
central themes film handled ineptly stereotypically depth imagination
pretty pictures world make piece work flawed core
hour half waste time following bunch pretty high schoolers whine cry life
cant relate hell barely can understand
definitely cult classic well worth viewing sharing others
movie pure disaster story stupid editing worst seen confuses incredibly
fish badly made underwater shots repeated thousand times film
truly truly bad film
acting terrible writing worse
possible way movie redeemed mst3k fodder
paid much
also real treat see anthony quinn playing crazy horse
boring
plot whatsoever
plot
horrible
worst hour half lifeoh gosh
walk theatre minutes just get relief
hate movies like
yeah movie pretty much sucked
plot storyline
go see movie bring pillow girlfriendboyfriend keep occupied
awful
dont think ive ever gone movie disliked much
good thing tickets cost five dollars mad id paid see crap
nobody identifies characters theyre cardboard cutouts stereotypes predictably reversestereotypes
bad film bad writing good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted paul haggis people cant handle anything bold strokes storytellinga picture painted crayons
crash depressing little nothing provokes emotion teaches nothing already know racism prejudice bad things
still like movie empowerment women theres enough movies like one
brain will attempt shutdown part primal impulse selfpreservation
left shattered experience watching film took good two hours fully recover
movie now joins revenge boogeyman zombiez part hellish trinity horror films
certainly mean distinction good way
mean terrible way
film redeeming features
everything appalling
artless camerawork endlessly presents us ugliest setting imaginable ie
story beyond stupid
script iswas script
kids annoying
lead man charismafree
utterly without merit level akin torture
ill even say torture
maybe reasonable explanation atrocity
pleasant voyage selfdiscovery
highly unrecommended
premise sound stupid thats
yes bad
nothing recommend
excellent performance ms
garbo showed right bat talents carry silent era wanted see silent work netflix doesnt seem stocking
also great see renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed step going silent sound
movie suffered writing needed suspense
many close ups
movie seemed drag heroes didnt really work freedom
movie definitely average rent
youll love
movie bad
bad
film way long
definitely one bad ones
movie received great quality film age
john wayne incredible job young movie industry
screen presence shined thought even though senior actors screen
think must see older john wayne film
really dont see anyone enjoy movie
dont think ive ever seen movie half boring selfindulgent piece junk
probably better director hadnt spent movie showcasing art work really isnt noteworthy
another thing didnt really like character got punched face gallon blood spew forth soon
jamie foxx absolutely ray charles
performance simply genius
owns film just spacek owned coal miners daughter quaid owned great balls fire
fact hard remember part ray charles acted played man
ray charles legendary
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material film goes well beyond just another movie musician
hitchcock great director
ironically mostly find films total waste time watch
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected thriller chase movie
pandering audience sabotages films
hence whole story lacks certain energy
plot simply rumbles like machine desperately depending addition new scenes
usual hitchcock logic flaws
mishima extremely uninteresting
chilly unremarkable movie author livingworking chilly abstruse culture
flat reenactments dont hold attention emotionally adrift stagy
rest just sits awful soldiers singing songs masculinity pledge hairsplitting purity admiration swords etc
can bore pieces kill momentum movie quicker anyone else
schrader made resume full lousy amateurish films
first watched movie loved
totally fascinated music dancing everything
however recently watched whole thing dvd completely struck extremely stupid storyline contained holes inconsistencies frankly whole lot crap horrid dancing
mean realistic world never gotten ballet repertory whole thing quite pathetic
character developments also lacked depth
woa talk awful
waste time
just horrible
worst sappiest dialogue go
really made unwatchable direction
poor actors
cant even tell talent pathetic lines speak director gave action
check directors filmography site will see film didnt chance
even good made tv flick
good intentions made film great film might one greatest films ever made
film great actors master director significant themeat least wouldbe significant theme undertone fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes thrilled senses imagination characters one might deeply care
regrettably film fails
movie lacks visual interest drama expression feeling celebration patriotism underlines narrative
actress worse used june allison movie
yet enjoy watching
unfortunately bad movie just plain bad
bad script bad direction horrible acting make one plain bad
dialogue sucked
cinematographyif can called thatsucked
soundtrack sucked
acting sucked
concert sequences just sucked

highly recommend movie anyone interested art poetry theater politics japanese history
wind lion see wonderful rendering americas imperial age
makes story different terrific production values faultless photography composition editing terrific casting underappreciated brian keith playing bully teddy vivid history
though wind lion told largely eyes son every member family can identify one characters whether sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick
high adventure best
think robert ryans best film portrayed someone like father schizophrenic real lifemy father although never murdered anyone affected second world war made worse
humour just get get day apt
mother brother thiswhen saw robert ryan portraying type man good imitation type individual impressed
almost songs cover girl oldfashioned tuneful
annoying thing cover girl way rita hayworth put pedestal
unfortunately cover girl example hollywood used exploit women financial gain
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks every part articulated quite well
good cinematography also makes monica bellucci look beautiful
good commentary todays love undoubtedly film worth seeing
people first timers film making think excellent job
popular cinema good house good reactions plenty laughs
feelgood film thats felt came cinema
northern humour positive community represents
rather enjoyed

setting
interesting premise billy drago always good dangerous nutbag side note id love see drago stephen mchattie lance hendrikson flick together talk raging cheekbones
soundtrack wasnt terrible either
actingeven professionals drago debbie rochonwas terrible directing worse perhaps contributory former dialog chimplike camera work barely tolerable
still sets got big oyvey scale
yes simplifying things sake brevity really core problems film much going without real fulfilling explanation
good jobs quite amusing
convoluted plot just didnt convince much film watched weird questioning glance
let girlfriend talk seeing bad idea hated
last minutes movie also bad well
bela lugosi totally extraneous intoning odd lines
acting decidely wooden though worse period universal b movie
like armand assante cable companys summary sounded interesting watched twice already probably will
believe screenwriter good job tying loose ends
score mostly plot
wont say dont like spoilers dont want one believe film worth time
wow bad film
frightening least barely comprehensible
plot doesnt hang together acting absolutely appalling
even good camp value
wasnt expecting oscar material
youd iq particularly stupid mollusk see one coming
film use word loosely insult moviegoing public
someone involved knew string together narrative
gets simply theres nothing lower
one watched recently fox movie channel disappointed
know contract player little control scripts acting bad script
victor mclaglen even bad brian donlevy almost unrecognizable
considering relations screen taylor stanwyck surprising little chemistry screen two
premise film ridiculous president us
death row scenes entirely unmoving
thing worse taylors acting stanwycks singing
whatever producer going missed entirely
deeply impressed character played
knew saw film great things come gifted actor
cheap cheerless heist movie poor characterisation lots underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat better tomorrow cheesy clichs thrown abandoned factory ready poorly executed flying judo rolls la john woo
even squibs look awful
point proceedings look remotely like america
plot derivative predictable ending like mercy killing
awful dialogue hopeless overacting everyone gets shot top real waste space time
uneasy bad movie scared
dialogue composed things make little sense
minutes footage wasted show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough make teen goth blush almost always olde english sometimes latin may may made words
directing sloppy best
hackneyed writing certainly made even worse bad directing
course acting blah
acting whole cast put scale balanced perfectly overacting underacting
finally get ending wouldve great handled competent people jerry falwell
loved movie great portrayal family share ups end knew special love
seen many movies starring jaclyn smith god one best though came years ago
movie contained allstar cast loved opened eyes see actors havent seen
movie kind long length enjoyed every minute
overall rate movie scale
lifetime air enough anyone knows store sells let know musthave
particularly remember senses assaulted strident cords music blare little warning even less meaning
just sort pap screened afternoon punish unemployed jobs
totally different loads understatement black comedy film get see will remember
movie creates universe fascinating every way
movie really got

really hope team behind movie makes movies will continue kinda weird style
forgot casting superb trond fausa aurvg perfect role bothersome man doesnt understand
movie good humorous comment life
found move beautiful enjoyable uplifting
initially local sites film filmed buffalo intrigued
later found lost power film
entire audience applauded conclusion film
left theater lilt step joy heart hope human race
duris wholesome appearance gives fine performance
rest cast also play well
cinematography noteworthy including fine views barcelona famed gaudi towers
ten minutes film started second thoughts
half way film started dislike
time film ended disliked despised
film lacks convincing script
script looks rough draft written shooting began finished script completed
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur real reason script calls
cast good
worth checking
probably irritating show ever seen entire life
indescribably annoying idiotic show ever seen
everything just bad
understand kind idiot produce mess first place mention several season
script bad bad contains cheesiness unethical joke normally see rated r movie
casting also horrible cause see really really bad actors period
final word show real torture
zillion times away reality
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt eyes much show
rating grade z note show bad even mother cast pull daughter show
century foxs road house quite silly noir implausible unmitigated bore movie
full unconvincing cardboard characters blandly written edward chodorov also produced surprisingly directed jean negulesco one expect great deal
widmark character turns unintentionally comical
losing marbles early proceedings totally implausible unconvincing
isnt enough mess movie picture also marred constant use studio sets indoor exteriors
whatever prompted documentary beyond
serious spoilers movie huge disappointment
many problems dont know start
cast great
steve martin delivers really funny performance middleaged upper class uptight white guy
add betty white jean smart great cast everyone played parts really well
movie makes lot serious mistakes
first enough racial stereotypes racial jokes offend everyone
movie littered overt racial slurs towards black cast members return whites depicted morons boobs
putting race card aside lets look major flaw film destroy latifas character
real plot
wouldnt see movie free
steamboat willie amazingly important film cinema history
second appearance mickey mouse following silent plane crazy earlier year probably famous filmmostly groundbreaking
dont yet hear mickey speak tons sound effects music throughout filmsomething take granted now huge crowd pleaser
however seeing short 25 years amazed timeless film actually
just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey straw highly imaginative occasionally cruel way
clever real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even wonderful years
bipolarity ruthless thug one minute ruthless killer next minute luvs diaper commercial completely unconvincing
im terribly disappointed film receive many awards accolades especially far deserving works film
original body soul masterpiece
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed one greatest cinematographers ever grace screenjames wong howe
dont think redeeming qualities remake
may bad film ever made
badwellits just bad
movie solid example bad plot bad idea way
shame see good actors like thomerson james make living mess like
thought bad
films terrible credit version watchable
lets start problemsthe acting especially lead professor bad
script big flawed mess
best example dumb writing established can turn zombiestudents back humans removing necklace containing piece meteorite
director paul matthews also wrotedirected weak monster movie grim clearly doesnt know pace films
movie terribly boring places
lighting awful
film looks cheap bland
one disappointing aspects lack notable gore
convention never worked well past certainly doesnt work
visual effects awful
cg opening sequence space looked like created microsoft slideshow gods sake
explosion gas tanks end just awful
okay like consider fair critic ill give credit credits duethe creature effects actually pretty cool
gotta love closeups slimy drooling teeth
sum film breeders terrible cheaply made horror movie avoided like ebola virus
recommended
almost unbearable watch screen little charisma terrible comedic timing
aside terrible lead film loads debits
understand supposed cheap popcorn comedy doesnt mean completely insult intelligence writing incredibly hackneyed borders offensive
lewis blacks considerable talent wasted incendiary unrestrained rating certainly wont allow
films sole bright spot jonah hill will look almost unrecognizable fans recent superbad due amount weight lost interim
originality freshness first movie now spent remake little else offer
budget evidently limited
reflected cast also belowpar script borrowed much earlier classic
however decent acting action location work balance things
filmiing less expansive
failed convey broad sweep landscapes great part original
generally just lacked imagination
recommended
possible movie get worse
plot keep going first place
even women finally show sign improvement expected things happen time film might far asleep
beware trashy cult movie trash period
cant believe theres even sequel
precisely giving bad review
child truly enjoyed show can proudly say enjoyed big time even classical wb cartoons
tiny toons kept vibe delivered one popular funny underrated cartoons ever created
memories murky can say enjoyed every single episode product related show
easily none cartoon made laugh tender way getting dark sitcoms oriented teenagers
characters funny peculiarity true lead character
every single character hilarious deserved called lead
every element story top excessively phony contrived painful sit
lines seem written fifteen year old though trying oh hard sound like fifteen year old really um know well talk
perabo nice energy level obviously comfortable front camera
simply excuse something poorly done
saw movie thought stupid movie
even stupid thought idea volcano los angeles
honest unbelievable nonsense foolish
conclusion will bother movie volcano los angeles nothing nonsense
story line just awful
just painful
accents absolutely abysmal
theres also enough hypocrisy film make vomit
dont waste time watching rubbish nonresearched film
believe pitch black done well
characters interesting want find longer movie goes think people will surprised doesnt make
go watch
omit watching
funny
rating just 3
characters interesting really care
instant classic great soundtrack catchy song ending credits
dont miss
masterful piece filmmaking many themes simmering occasionally boiling warts study poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years span aerial bombardments london outward tranquillity welsh coastal retreat borderlines friendship lust love dedication art experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice egotism versus heroism selfsacrifice

exquisite visual composition moment inventive elegant use closeup camera angle lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage wonder joy behold
continuously beautiful look bertolucci relationships convincing narrative engaging masters work
basic premise wasted since sidelined inexplicable focus documentary crew
regardless film fails levels
avoid costs

excellently produced one scifis best producers scot vandiver
entertaining nonetheless
campy sort film thats joy watch
theres barely boring moment film plenty humorous parts
cast always entertaining usual
overall delight

watch however small consolations actresses playing annes sisters wonderful job roles
good
speaking music unbearably predictably kitchy
film just dropped ball
stunning movie
raw sublimely moving
felt like gripping intelligent stage play without overly theatrical feeling one actually gets watching people stage plays everyones terror white lie escalating monstrous consequences
main players mesmerising
tom wilkinson broke heart end everyone elses judging amount fumbling hankies hands going faces among males females alike

everything want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating youre looking beall endall brainsucking movies look
great sound effects impressive special effects cant recommend movie enough
call nut think one best movies ever
great character actors telly savalas peter boyle
hour 54 minutes sheer tedium melodrama horrible acting mess script sinking feeling good lord thinking
lots holes script
like bad two hour tv movie
now imagine every single one decisions made wrong
dialogue atrocious
acting beyond abysmal
everything stinks
trouble writing directing make impossible establish things make movie watchable like character story theme
worse theres incredibly weak subplot thrown follows little band latterday mansonites go reporter whos working story anniversary killings
dumb pointless complete waste time
short dont bother movie
wont spoil ending pretty amazing
best scene movie end wont spoil
ever indication writer directors ability meld two highly volatile temperaments seamless union creativity
result powerhouse achievement made timely now perhaps cultures disturbing fascination celebrity distorted interpretations fame
film easily forgotten
kevin spacey excellent verbal tsunami buddy ackerman totally believable great actor
scripting subtle comedy unmatched movie recent years
characters interesting even bit predictable
highly recommended ages although younger set will probably appreciate subtle references will certainly appreciate one galley scene particular
great movie
also story acting weak
around 4 pm bought around 8pm started watch around fast forwarded remaining film see anything left watchable human brain wasnt
either way sucks
script horrendously stupid
story starts fast absolutely suspense buildup slightest

story lame interesting never really explains sinister origins puppets
arent death scenes like previous movies fx terrible
felt asleep first time watched can recommend insomniacs
fact film wonderful heartwarming tale two people chasing dreams
best part nurse betty unpredictability
director neil labute uses brutal violence seperate dreams reality along touching drama hilarious comedy can never tell going happen next
otherwise dont even waste time
